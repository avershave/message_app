# Message App

## Frontend: Quick Overview

- This was mostly made to test the backend but decided to include it in the assessment.
- The front end is React. I did not use Redux to make sure the application is simple.
- The all of the styling is Bootstrap. Again, to keep the application simple.
- The front end also uses a token that is stored in the client.
- Use command npm install then npm start to run the React app.

## Backend: Quick Overview

- Coded in Express for simplicity. Wanted to show I understand creating RESTful API's.
- I am still flexible in different languages. For example, I can use Flask, Django, ASP.net, etc.

## OneNote Link
[This a link to my notes I took before starting the assessment.](https://onedrive.live.com/view.aspx?resid=6F3C5A85CF37107%2174101&id=documentsonenote:https://d.docs.live.net06f3c5a85cf37107/Documents/backend%20assessment/)

## Client

- I am assuming that this will be some sort of web app using MVC.
- I also assume that the client will store a token in order to authenticate.
- Frontend will make API calls in order to receive data.

## Server

- Coded in Express.
- I am assuming there will be some validation in the frontend.
- Set up as a RESTful API with CRUD Users and Messages.
- I know the requirements do not need a full CRUD but wanted to add for future use.
- To start the server, npm install. Run the command nodemon server. Will run on localhost:5000.

## Datastore

- Database is MongoDB.
- There's a docker-compose file available to use if you want to quickly setup a MongoDB instance.
- I chose MongoDB because I am comfortable with it, it has easy syntax, and searches efficiently.
- Uses JSON to communicate.
